    PSNR is Peek Signal to Noise Ratio, which is similar to mean squared error.

    It can be calculated as
    PSNR = 20 * log10(MAXp) - 10 * log10(MSE)

    When providing an unscaled input, MAXp = 255. Therefore 20 * log10(255)== 48.1308036087.
    However, since we are scaling our input, MAXp = 1. Therefore 20 * log10(1) = 0.
    Thus we remove that component completely and only compute the remaining MSE component.
