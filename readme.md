# SuperSR

A completion of data-preprocessing and models of SR(based on CNN) research.

## To Do List

- [ ]    Multiprocessing when generate h5 files and or subimages' dir
- [ ]    Try PyTables to save and generate data.
- [ ]    Finish the downsample first mode when generating data and label.
- [ ]    Comments are incomplete, under fixing.
- [ ]    Delete the slice first mode and set downsample first mode as Default.
- [ ]    Tensorboard visulization is incompleted. Weights visualization need to be considered.
- [ ]    Add texture extraction method in Dataset.
- [ ]    Add clustering algorithm in utils.py
- [ ]    try different upsample module in EDSR 8X model.
- [ ]    Figure out how to import my own moduals.
- [ ]    Rewrite the image_utils.py to be more readable and scalable.
- [ ]    Add feature extraction in image_utils.py
- [ ]    Fix Comments in image_utils.py
- [ ]    Test if the models work on this version.
